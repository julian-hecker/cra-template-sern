## SERN App
Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the [SERN template](https://github.com/julian-hecker/cra-template-sern).

Makes it easy to connect the frontend to the backend out-of-the-box.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run start`
Runs the server for production

### `npm run dev`
Runs the frontend and backend servers simultaneously in development mode.

### `npm run start-react`
Starts only the react development server (no backend)

### `npm run build`
Creates a production build

### `npm run test`
Runs tests (not implemented by default)

### `npm run eject`
Ejects react app (won't be able to receive CRA updates)
